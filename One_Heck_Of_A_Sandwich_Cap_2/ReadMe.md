# About One Heck of-a Sandwich Shop ðŸ˜ˆðŸ¥ª
This project is developing a point of sale (POS) application for One Heck of a Sandwich Shop, a custom sandwich shop, to streamline and automate the ordering process. 
It will leverage object-oriented programming principles by organizing the system into well-structured classes and interfaces that represent sandwiches, sides, orders, and more. 
The development starts with a class flowchart to guide the architecture, which will be updated and maintained in the project repository as the application evolves.

# Roadmap ðŸš§ðŸ¥ª
1. I started by thoroughly reviewing the project documentation to determine which classes would be needed for the application.
2. Then, I created a flowchart using Draw.io to visualize how the system components interact. 
Although the diagram appears a bit chaotic, I used color-coded arrows to clearly indicate which classes and code belong to each package, helping me understand how everything works together.
3. First, I created a package named Heck_Emuns, which stores all the constant variables needed throughout the project. This package is divided into three classes.
* BreadType, which contains the following constants: WHITE, WHEAT, RYE, and WRAP. These represent the different types of bread available for customers at the sandwich shop.
* DrinkSize, which contains the following constants: SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE. These represent the different types of drink sizes available for customers at the sandwich shop.  
* SandwichSize, which contains the following constants: FOUR_INCH, EIGHT_INCH, TWELVE_INCH. These represent the different lengths of sandwiches available for customers at the sandwich shop.
