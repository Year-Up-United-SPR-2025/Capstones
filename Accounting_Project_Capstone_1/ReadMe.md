# About Accounting Program Capstone 1 ðŸ§®
In this project, I built a Java CLI application to track financial transactions for either business or personal use. The application stores all transactions in a file named transactions.csv, with each transaction saved as a single line containing important details: date, time, description, vendor, and amount.
I developed this project using IntelliJ, which provided robust features like real-time code suggestions, file management, and integrated terminal support, making development smoother and more efficient.

The application leverages several Java classes to perform its core functions:

* import java.time.LocalTime; and import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter; were used to capture and format the time each transaction was recorded.

* import java.util.Scanner; enabled user interaction through the command-line interface.

* import java.io.BufferedReader;, import java.io.FileReader;, and import java.io.FileWriter; were essential for reading from and writing to the transactions.csv file.

* import java.io.IOException; helped handle file I/O exceptions.

Overall, this application reads from and writes to the transaction file to help users record, store, and review financial data efficiently through a clean, text-based interface.

# Roadmap ðŸš§
1. I looked through the documentation and Created the classes that I needed for my program to work:
* A Transaction Class contains a constructor, Setters and Getters and a overwrite method to save date, time, description, vendor, and amount.
* An Exit Handler to handel when the user is done with the program using the Scanner and to accomplish this.
* This class is responsible for handling all file and time-related operations for the ledger system. It performs the following functions:

Read from File: Reads and displays transaction data from the transactions.csv file directly to the terminal.

Write to File: Writes new transaction entries (deposits or payments) to the transactions.csv file.

Timestamp Entries: Automatically captures the current date and time when a new transaction is entered and includes it in the file.

* The Ledger class manages and displays financial transactions from a CSV file. It provides a home menu interface for viewing deposits, payments, and vendor-based reports. It reads transaction data from transactions.csv on initialization and filters entries based on user input.
* Finally, a Main class that contains that displays Entering a date, description, vendor, amount, greetings and a closing text when the code is done running.

# Screenshots ðŸ“¸

This is that 1st thing you see when you run this app it displays the current time, asks you for the date (YYYY-MM-DD), 
Enter the Description (What is the item user purchased), Add the Vendor, and lastly Enter the Amount. Once the transaction is complete the message Transaction Added! will appear.

You could also add another transaction if you wanted to by pressing Y or y to ann another when Do you want to add another transaction? (y/n) shows up and then when you're done you could exit the app early by pressing Do you want to exit the app? (y/n)

![Ledger Screen List.png](Screenshots/Ledger%20Screen%20List.png)

Once you press N or n you will see the list of items previously in the ledger and the newer additions as well

After that you will see the home screen to show your options:

As shone here you can press D or d to get deposits:

Pressing p or P to get payments:

Using r or R you can pull up specific transactions:

Using h or H to make sure your on the home screen:

Finally, e or E to x or X to exit app:

# Interesting piece of Code
![carbon.png](Screenshots/carbon.png)

I thought that this was an interesting piece of code because thanks to this I was able to hardcode when time when the entry was made so that way you would not have to add it yourself.

# Special Thanks 
Thank you to one of my teammates who helped me find a good Readme creator called https://readme.so/ to help make this readme template, and using https://carbon.now.sh/ to create the screenshots above, and to my professor who caught little issues like my name conventions and little mistakes that I missed when making this project.
